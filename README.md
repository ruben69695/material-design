## Motivation
Fork, added variation to only material design theme, changed some colors that don't work very well with my eyes, (from my perpective).

## Source
**Material Design forked from source 3rd-party ruTorrent theme, I'm not going to always keep them up-to-date so here are the source link:**

* [3rd-party ruTorrent theme](https://github.com/artyuum/3rd-party-rutorrent-themes)

## Requirements
 
* [ruTorrent](https://github.com/Novik/ruTorrent)
* [Plugin: Theme](https://github.com/Novik/ruTorrent/wiki/PluginTheme)
* git: `apt-get install git`
